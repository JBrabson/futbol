**Project: FUTBOL**
**Group Member Names: Keegan O'Shea, Zach Bergman, Alexander Brueck, Jennifer Brabson**

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project? 
GitHub collaboration and familiarizing with the process; CSV file I/O; group dynamics (scheduling/delegation);
project planning.

* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
In larger group projects, collaboration style depends on stage of project and scheduling conflicts. Generally, 
may be most beneficial to start as a whole team to get on same page of direction, and split into pairs/paired
programming as needed/available. Daily meetups as a whole will help keep sights aligned/allow for most beneficial
problem solving. Group direction is agreed upon as a whole; individual tasks are environment to code "individually"
with opportunity to collaborate and refactor at the end.

* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
Overcommunication is best and prevents issues arising from lack of (heads-up vs post-notification).
Slack to be used as means of communication; screensharing during team meet-ups.

* How would you describe your work style?
Keegan: Collaborative environments best for mapping out; independent work for more detailed tasks. 
Zach: Collaborative environments best for mapping out; independent work for more detailed tasks.
Alexander: Most productive in focused settings.
Jennifer: Collaborative environments best for mapping out; independent work for more detailed tasks.

Helpful to have contributor narrate additions/adjustments to code.

* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
Keegan: Curious - which leads to better collaboration/more problem solving abilities.
Zach: Disciplined in follow-through and task completion.
Alexander: Resourceful in problem solving; math jedi.
Jennifer: Like to research for methods/problem solvers.

* What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
Keegan: Can improve on using recently learned material; taking by piecemeal. 
Zach: Roadmapping - setting the direction/pace of project; GitHub gauntlet navigating. Success in efficient scheduling.
Alexander: Good ying/yang flow with skills between partners as well as scheduling/communication.
Jennifer: Mapping out/diagraming and assigning specific tasks to classes.

TDD to be of heavy focus.

* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
DTR established and adjusted if/as needed. Group collab to set direction; agreement for decisions as we go.
Group meets at first assigned Project Work Time; meets on days without schedule time TBD day or of during meet day prior.

* How will we overcome obstacles?
Group Dynamics: Open Door mentality; kind and constructive. (Don't be an asshole.)
Technically: Talking through/google happy; coming to group agreement.

* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
Keegan: Same as below (including roadblocks - sooner than later - to allow for group rescue).
Zach: Focused environment, knowledgable resources, updated progress within group.
Alexander: Updated updates to allow for most working potential; strong communication.
Jennifer: Yes to all of the above.

* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
Keegan: Hard stop 10pm. Available in hours prior to class. MST
Zach: Most productive in mornings - hard stop 8-9pm(ish). MST
Alexander: In peak contribution mode by 8am. Hard stop 9pm. MST
Jennifer: Unavailable in AMs. 1 hour window after class unavailable to pickup daughter (between 4-5:15pm).
Can be the late night gopher for unfinished tasks.

All members will adjust where able to accomodate group scheduling.

* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
Keegan: Where appropriate and necessary; given as needed in areas that will be relevant going forward. Similarly, live
feedback given on positives.
Zach: Honest feedback with good-intention.
Alexander: Direct, concise.
Jennifer: Compliment sandwiches all day. Constructive with examples, not just the criticism.

* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project?
Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project?
How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
Keegan: Could use improvement with class interaction.
Zach: Can strengthen TDD.
Alexander: Solid in logical thinking. Improvement to be made within syntax and interactions of Ruby. Comfortable with methods and defining; working on
inheritance/transversing verticals.
Jennifer: Pseudocoding is nonexistent in my skills. Need to improve on TDD and not use DDD in larger scale projects (will
prevent oversaturating classes with methods to be assigned elsewhere).

* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
Keegan: Rock/Resources to validate approach/vision early on; managing right direction.
Zach: Reachouts to mentor for course corrections. 
Alexander: repl.it
Jennifer: 2011 Friends.

* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
Reach out in group channel/Table the issue for group collaboration.

* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
A clean, finished project/product is completion... but success is when each member of the team understands the product and
learned along the way.

* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
Keegan: Yes to below.
Zach: Yes to below.
Alexander: Off the cuff, recognize little wins for eachother.
Jennifer: Real time, verbal.


### Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine
* What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)
Video off preferred for intense coding sessions; on when more beneficial to group progress.
* If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place?
  (This could have answers like  asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype. 
Prompt communication and knowing quickest backup options.
* Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence
  look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?
As needed; pulse checking; individuality at its finest.
* Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others.
  How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?
Intro chat before jumping into business (as one may do in person). Tapping into the ol' EQ.
